                    Before you file, you will need a Federal Employer Identification Number
                    (FEIN). If you are not required to have one, you will need a Taxpayer
                    Identification Number. If you do not have a federal identification
                    number, contact the IRS to obtain one at

                    Only employers who actually have employees working in the state of
                    Wisconsin are required to pay UI taxes to this state. If you only have
                    Wisconsin residents working in a state other than Wisconsin, you
                    are not required to pay UI taxes or file Quarterly reports here
                </li>

                    You can check on our home page for more information on what types of
                    employment are excluded for unemployment tax purposes.

                    If you do not have or plan to have any covered employees working in
                    Wisconsin, nothing is required of you. Please note that Corporate Officers
                    are covered employees.

                    To determine if your worker is an Employee or an Independent Contractor,
                    use the <a href="https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/worker-classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Workforce Development's Employee Classification</a>
                    page to review steps to classify a worker. Failure to properly classify
                    workers as employees will result in the assessment of back taxes, interest,
                    and civil penalties and may result in criminal penalties.
